# Rules of programming

Follows the rules of programming used in writing code:

1. '{' in the same line of function declaration, not new line EX: 
```
    int Class::text(type parametr) {
```


2. Use uppercase to separate words EX:
```
    GenericMethodOfGenericClass(); 
```



3. Use = or other operator space divider EX: 
```
    pippo = 17;
```

4. Use if space divider EX: 
```
    if( pippo == 17){...}
```

5. Use a new line to separate different paragraph, methods, function

6. Use a space before comment a use-line

7. Includes order is: standard libraries - 3rd part libraries - personal libraries EX:
```
    #include <iostream>\
    #include <QMainWindow>\
    #include <MyClass.h>
```
    
8. Order of class members: public - protected - private. If a section would be left empty, then there isn't needed to add it
